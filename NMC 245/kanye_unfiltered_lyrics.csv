All Falls Down,The College Dropout,"[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downYeah, this the real one, babyI'm tellin' you all, it all falls downUh, Chi-Town, stand up!Oh, when it all, it all falls downSouthside, Southside
We gon' set this party off rightI'm tellin' you all, it all falls downWestside, Westside
We gon' set this party off rightOh, when it all
[Verse 1: Kanye West]Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in collegeThat major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funnyNow, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really careShe's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter AlexisShe had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like EveAnd she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downC'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all
[Verse 2: Kanye West]Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazyI can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a teamIt seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteemThe prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond ringsWe shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade usWe tryna buy back our 40 acresAnd for that paper, look how low we'll stoopEven if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downCome on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downAnd when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls downCome on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downAnd when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'emWe buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'emThings we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of thatBut I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]Oh, when it all, it all falls downC'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downC'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls downSouthside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downWestside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls downChi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls downNow, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my lifeC'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down[Produced by Kanye West]",G# minor,0.657,0.734,0.434,91.03
Breathe In Breathe Out,The College Dropout,"[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys outGirls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe outLet them hoes fight, pull her weave outIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""
[Verse 1: Kanye West]Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsackAlways said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims againAnd it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium""What'cha gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so brokeI look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with me y'all[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys outGirls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave outIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college
And dropped out of school quickI always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dickLadies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited timeAct now and get some action for a $free.99
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddyCuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked
""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys outGirls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave outIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""
[Verse 3: Kanye West]I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In the four dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weaponPullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrousCoulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""So say my name like CandymanAnd I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe[Chorus: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys outGirls go wild and pull ya D's out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave outIf a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be rightYeah, you heard the track I did man, ""This Can't Be Life""Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do itWhen I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laughWho knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dogI feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog

And come back next year with the whole fucking gameAin't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flopThen maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here

It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhymeNow I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassedBut without it I'd be last, so I ought to laughSo I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no moreI rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, niggaI'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton MomI ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cardsI prayed to the skies and I changed my starsI went to the malls and I balled too hard""Oh my god, is that a black card?""

Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' withSo won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't youAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""[Saxophone Solo]
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
[Hiphop: ""I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper""]I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back thenI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""[JAY-Z: ""Oh you a real soulful dude, man""]And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said
[JAY-Z: ""Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here""]
""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""
[JAY-Z: ""so what you think of this?""]
And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...
[Mother: ""Come on, let's just go""]
...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...
[Mother: ""Kanye, baby, we're here""]
...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
[Hiphop: ""No I think Jay gon' like this one right here""]And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""
[Dame: ""Yo, you that kid, Kanye?""]
""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""
[Dame: ""Jay got classics, G.""]
You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""
[JAY-Z: ""That, that was cool. That was hot.""]
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...
[Jessica: ""Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.""]
I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up
[""Y'all niggas is stupid""]
Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad
[Joe: ""We gonna change the game, buddy.""]
Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""
[Dame: ""You gotta make sure it's not wack.""]
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""
[Dame: ""Oh shit it's not even wack.""]
""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""
[Dame: ""it's actually kinda hot.""]
Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""
[Dame: ""you don't wanna catch a brick""]
""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""
[Mel: ""Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.""]
And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""So won't you raise your glass, won't you...

Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be differentNow niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' itRacism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn clubThey even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's ClubI done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four timesBut in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us savedLike it take a lot more than doo rags to get you wavesNothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought herYou sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled upBut I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye

We are all here for a reason on a particular pathYou don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individualMy spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritualBut I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyricalI'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent dayBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta KinteI'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self-down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you downAnd when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhymeSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns outTake 'em to church

Past the skyTryna tell you, man, way past the skyOh, oh (Let's go, ugh)
[Verse 2: GLC]
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mindLost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nopeHoller at God: ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow![Chorus: Kanye West, GLC, & Kanye w/ Choir]I've been working this grave-shiftAww, man, this pressureAnd I ain't made shitI wish I couldBuy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, ohI've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shitI wish I couldBuy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh[Verse 3: Consequence]I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing rightAnd havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fairI don't wanna ever go back thereSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow![Chorus: Kanye West & Kanye w/ Choir]I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shitI wish I couldBuy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, ohI've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shitI wish I couldBuy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh

Through The Wire,The College Dropout,"[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!
[Intro]Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Over Chorus]I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, manI'd gladly risk it all right nowIt's a life-or-death situation, manY'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, manIt's your boy, Kanye to the…Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
[Verse 1]I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessertSomebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserkNot to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerkHow do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett TillShe was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mineShe a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty signNo use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signedTryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelinesIn the same hospital where Biggie Smalls diedThe doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, manStory on MTV and I ain't tryna make a bandI swear, this right here, history in the makin', man
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Over Chorus]I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, manThey got my mouth wired shutFor like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe itBut I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
[Verse 2]What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong timeIn the blink of a eye, his whole life changedIf you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe beltI swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televisedThere's been an accident like GEICOThey thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did MichaelI must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his assUnbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas PastToys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumphMake music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
[Over Chorus]Y'know what I'm sayin'?When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chinI said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""You can't be serious, man[Produced by Kanye West]",G major,0.571,0.739,0.66,83.089

I got the perfect song for the kids to sing...And all my people that's—
[Chorus: Choir]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky highWe wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 1: Kanye West]If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own manBut as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people sayThis is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high(Kids, sing! Kids, sing!)We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still aliveThrow your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""
[Verse 2: Kanye West]This second verse is for my dogs working nine to five that still hustle'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55And everybody selling makeup, Jacob'sAnd bootlegged tapes just to get they cake upWe put shit on lay-away, then come backWe claim other people kids on our income taxWe take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people sayMama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take workThe drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weightSo niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straightBut we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—
[Chorus: Choir & Kanye West]Drug dealin' just to get by (Yeah)
Stack your money 'til it get sky highKids, sing! Kids, sing!We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive (Alive, uh-huh)Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, ugh)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smartWe ain't retards the way teachers thoughtHold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow classIt's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchairI'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned usWhen we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could goThen I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed (You make me smile)
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Co-Co-Coca Cola

Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, ok, ok (You make me smile with my heart)
Well I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just, uhh, not credibly

Bring Me Down,Late Registration,"[Produced by Kanye West and Jon Brion][Hook: Brandy]I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down[Verse: Kanye West]
We gon' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dreamThere'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""he say, she say""Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say ""Yo, no hablo inglés""And everybody want to run to me for their sing-le
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myselfDawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself!Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something!
[Bridge: Brandy]What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you

'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche

Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' himWhat more could you ask for? The international asshole

And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soulAnd wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fameWhen he came in the game, he made his own laneNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""Got family in the D, Kin-folk from MotownBack in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go downMy father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave itThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe itTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimicYeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemicAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off

People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my homeMy chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, manSee, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmsesI thought my Jesus piece was so harmless'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armlessAnd here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryin' to get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like IkeYou can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, 'cause

You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 1: Kanye West]My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the dayDown the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me aloneBulls jacket with his hat broke way offAnd walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the manBack when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by policesHow'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavyHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazyHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a carYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a babyOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got crankedWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin' now I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie

You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazingThem elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL MercedesIt's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the darkYou see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slabBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cabA young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie
[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homieIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homieLive today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something seriousI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a kingWith that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine, stay, you got the grind, hey
Came back, read what the sign say (He's gone)Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes

The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

We striving home
I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child goneAnd since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by tenBut I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
[Verse 5: Kanye West]I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's houseYeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'How we out in Europe, spending EurosThey claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all onI'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is freeBut if they ever flip sides like AnakinYou'll sell everything including the mannequinThey got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calmShorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs

Heard 'Em Say,Late Registration,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things they seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And people gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' on cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I can't figure it out, bring the drums in now, uh
[Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
That nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Kanye West]Uh, and I heard 'em say
With every worthless word, we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe (What?)
It hurts but it may be the only way[Outro: John Legend & Kanye West]And I heard 'em say
Oh, oh, oh, oh-ohYeah, and I heard 'em say

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mineThis little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bikeAnd you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
[Verse 2]Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to youYou was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommyCome on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)
[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)
[Verse 3]I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)
[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go

There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slowIf I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo

Baby, it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them Eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for thatI ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later?

[Verse: Common]
YeahThey say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate isI stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the massesThe young smoke grass in grassless junglesRubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remainsMakin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightinSomeone to stay in they corner like Mike TysonHypes fightin for hits to heighten they hellDon't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -
[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]""Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it

Never went home again""",G# major,0.593,0.596,0.776,86.965

And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay? But since she
Was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right hereMy grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he's strong
That's where I get my confidence fromI asked the nurse ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""

[Verse 1]It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, selloutPicture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell outYou know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
[Hook]Big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friendNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 2]Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for himI'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowdBig brother got his show up at Madison SquareAnd I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two ticketsI guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distanceBut everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potentOnly thing I wanna know is why I get looked overI guess I'll understand when I get more olderBig brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
[Hook]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brotherUsed to be Dame and Biggs' brotherWho was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friendNo I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?
[Verse 3]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, HovitoThe game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peepholeThen I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steepleAnd we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brotherOn that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my assSibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' meAt the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to beWhen I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-goI guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all knowI told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
[Bridge]My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brotherIf you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'emPeople never get the flowers while they can still smell 'emA idol in my eyes, god of the gameHeart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chainNever be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

You see how I creeped up?You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?I'll never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa CamOr rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing upPeople talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos

Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award

In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always beShe never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leaveShe said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on meI guess that's why last winter she got so cold on meShe said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
[Verse 2: Kanye West]But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout meShe said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like youBut they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not newNow everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's goneI guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back homeAnd guess when I heard that? When I was back homeEvery interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proudReach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloudJump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em aroundIf you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?

Pinocchio Story,808s & Heartbreak,"[Intro]
Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
[Verse 1]
It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about, no doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was aboutDo you think I'd sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real lifeReal life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life
[Chorus]I just wanna be a real boy
They always say: ""Kanye, he keeps it real boy""
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
[Verse 2]It's funny
Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin' for something out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life, to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feelDo you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: ""where's my camera?""
For everybody that sees you to say: ""sign an autograph""For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh
[Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes
[Verse 3]And there is no Gepetto to guide me
No one right beside me
The only one was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't call her no more
I can't—The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dreamAnd the fame will be get gotAnd the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin' the money that the—
You spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left for a real boy!
They say: ""Kanye, you keep it too real boy""Perspective and wise, man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say you'll find your way
The wise man say you'll find your way

So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraudDifferent traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapewormsSpinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burnsI shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-rollerI'm makin' love to the angel of death

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down[Verse 1: Kanye West]Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec BaldwinInter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than BrandonAnd at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's randomBut we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrativeThis the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did itI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?[Chorus: Kid Cudi]Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down[Verse 2: Kanye West]Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missingBut this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attentionAs long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meetBut this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my OlympicsWe make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dickAnd these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it[Chorus: Kid Cudi]Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

And that American Apparel girl in just tightsShe told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad newsI was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterdayAnd what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coachMy guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' cokeIt's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and OAnd kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shitAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls[Chorus: Kid Cudi]Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck itSteam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunkThe black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan

Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vaultMy childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted meAs I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

And at this rate we gon' both die brokeGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say noPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on TwitterMy friends' best advice was to stay lowI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payrollThe media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of controlI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they controlI know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmationThis generation's closest thing to EinsteinSo don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel likeTroll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressiveThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditionsMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producersDon't stare at money too long, it's MedusaThe ultimate Gemini has survived

But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chainsThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hardReal family stick together and see through the mirage

I am one with the people (Real!)I've been woken from enlightened man's dreamCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteemLet me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touchI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happenSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'

Drop my ego and confidence was my last resortI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams

One set of footsteps, You was carryin' meWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to seeI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov

This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day
[Chorus: Kid Cudi]I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
[Outro: 070 Shake]Whoa, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeahI put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah

I Thought About Killing You,ye,"[Intro: Francis and the Lights & Kanye West]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, knowI, I know it, I know it
[Spoken Word: Kanye West]The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkestToday, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murderAnd I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you loveThe most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the tableToday, I thought about killing you, premeditated murderI think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love youThe most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad thingsAnd I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myselfSo, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder
[Verse: Kanye West]I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb

Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see
[Chorus: 070 Shake]Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw

They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off

[Verse: Kanye West]Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' sillyI answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughtersDon't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she inIf you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?Let's pray we can put this behind usI swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as remindersBlood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
[Chorus: 070 Shake & Ty Dolla $ign]Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
